            As a surgical robotics software engineer, my primary responsibility
            is to develop and maintain the software backend that controls a
            image guided needle targeting robot named ANT-C. I have been working
            on ANT-C system which integrates with hospital's CT machine to
            assist doctors with needle procedures. This involves designing and
            coding the software that controls the movement and functionality of
            the robot. during needle targeting surgical procedures such as
            biopsy and ablation.
          </p>
          <p>
            To verify the accuracy and safety of the system, I have to devise
            experiments that test the performance of the robot. This involves
            running simulations and conducting real-world experiments with test
            jigs to evaluate the robot's accuracy and safety. Through these
            experiments, I help to identify any issues or areas for improvement
            in the software or hardware, and work to make adjustments as needed
            to optimize the performance and safety of the system.

        <p>
          My role as a subsea mechanical design engineer is to design subsea
          Christmas trees, which are mechanical assemblies used to regulate oil
          or gas flow from subsea wells. To achieve this, I create 3D CAD models
          and drawings, select materials, build the bill of materials, conduct
          simulations and calculations, oversee the fabrication and assembly
          processes, and design factory acceptance tests for the assemblies.
        </p>
        <p>
          After more than a year of design preparation, I was given the
          opportunity to travel to Montrose, Scotland headquarter where the
          manufacturing is taking place to give advices and make adjustments to
          parts and factory acceptance tests.

              As a design engineer, I have to regularly resolve NCRs
              (non-conformance) that arise during the manufacturing process.
              This involves identifying the root cause of the non-conformance,
              developing and implementing corrective actions, and ensuring that
              the corrective actions are effective in preventing similar issues
              from occurring in the future.

              As part of my responsibilities, I am tasked with designing Factory
              Acceptance Test for subassemblies to the API 6a standards. One of
              the test conducted was pressurising the inner bore as shown in the
              photo. The test designs will incorporate measures to verify the
              subassembly's functionality and to identify any potential problems
              under testing conditions.

              In my role as a design engineer, my primary responsibility is to
              ensure that my designed parts do not collide with one another and
              are assembled correctly. I need to be highly familiar with the
              manufacturing processes and the geometric tolerances to ensure
              that the final product meets all of the required quality
              standards.

            Furthermore, I have to do calculations to assess the mechanical
            strength and integrity of the assemblies. We have to ensure the
            stress points and forces that will be exerted on the assemblies
            during operation, and conducting simulations and tests to ensure
            that they are capable of withstanding these forces without
            experiencing any mechanical failure.

              Once the manufacturing, assembly and testing processes are

              vessel to the installation site, where it is carefully lowered
              into the sea and positioned on their respective wellheads.
